			<h2>  A bit of my stroy</h2>
			<p> 
				I've always had a passion for travel, and even spent two months with a host family in the United States. The road trip I took this summer enriched me and left me with so many beautiful memories. It left an indelible impression on me, as I drove along the magnificent coastline from Miami to New York. But now let me share with you the highlights of my adventure.
